Life is a game.  Upgrade your character.
"You must search for the shadows.  I promise, you will never be truly happy unless you've been truly sad.  You will never know peace unless you've known war.  Your soul longs for the light which you never find -  because you've always been too afraid to live in the dark."

Young Kings.  Life is harder as a man.  I like it.  Harder brings greater rewards.  There is no better human existence than a high-value male.  Top 1% men enjoy the planet more than any 1% woman ever could.  But a low-value male has the worst experience.  Risk vs reward.

"Young Kings.  I'm never ""on"" a diet, because I’m never ""off"" a diet.  My entire life is a diet.  Nutritionally. Emotionally. Fiscally. Etc.  Favorable results are born from self-control.  Avoid the on/off, it's easier and more effective to adopt this as a lifestyle."

"It is good hearted, strong, honorable, courageous men which will TAKE CARE of the women in their lives.  Its these types of men which built the modern world.  The number one way you help women, is to help men be better men.  I do more good for women than any feminist ever has."
The BBCs true nature was shown when they insinuated that the Tate’s charity work was disingenuous.   I’ve known the Tates for decades.   They have always been charitable on the quiet.  Before they had money they were generous with their time/knowledge.   Their hearts are pure.

I want to make this very clear.  The Romanian people and the Romanian government/judges are not my enemies.  EVERY policeman I’ve spoken to has offered apologies that they are “doing this” to me (they’ve seen it 1000 times).   5 Romanian people did this.  5.  I love Romania.
