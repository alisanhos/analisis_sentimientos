Most people overestimate the time it takes to accomplish things.  You can accomplish what most people take years to do within months.  It's something you need to FEEL to believe.
They’ve brainwashed you.  That's why you can feel something isn’t quite right.  Your soul is fighting against the poison they’ve injected into your MIND.  You must be true to yourself. Your masculine urge of conquest.  Do not be defeated by apparitions.  Resist the slave mind.
