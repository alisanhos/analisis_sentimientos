"Young Kings.  There is no worse fate for your son but for him to have daddy’s money as a safety net.  This generational wealth crap is for soft men, who want to replicate soft men.  I am not me because I'm rich.  I'm me because I’m rich AND everything else.  Do you understand?"

It’s crazy that America dropped 2 nuclear bombs on major Japanese cities and they never bring it up. Like they just got over it

Don’t let winning get to your head. You’re not so popular.  You find out your real friends when you lose.
"Stop living for other people because when you win, they win - and everybody wants some of the prize.   But when you lose?   You take that L on your own."
"Do not speak negatively my friend.   Negative energy is sticky.   Even if you pry it from the fabric of the universe, it leaves residue."

There is a strange sense of terror that comes from knowing exactly what is going to happen.  There is a strange sense of calm that comes from knowing exactly what is going to happen.
"Money is a defence. Money does not solve all problems, but there are problems that only money can solve. Without money you become a prey, a victim and a slave to the rich. Money gives you options. Money helps you enforce your personal power and live life on your own terms."

"A lot of people comment on the fact I have a swollen face and black eyes.   It’s nothing to do with that weird black eye occult thing.   Altho 5 years retired, coach treats me the same.   No mercy."
The reason I work so hard when I make over 10 million dollars a month is because I simply love brotherhood and teamwork. I dont need money.  Theres nothing id rather do than work towards a goal with likeminded brothers.  ONLY UP.

May Allah free Andrew Tate

Hello
Fire.
America has a hero making problem.  The average kid growing up has no clue what behavior will receive the highest level of recognition/Love.  Think about it.
Alex Jones was right.   But it’s not the frogs they want.   It’s the kids.
First world country? You mean... Ghey?
"As a man, you get to build your character.   Life is like a video game.   I’ll never understand why most people decided to play the game weak and dumb."
Andrew Tate would never kill himself.

Toxic generosity is a real thing:    Give once: you elicit appreciation;  Give twice: you create anticipation;  Give 3 times: you create expectation;  Give 4 times: it becomes entitlement;  Give 5 times:  you establish dependency.  Stop giving: you become an ENEMY
I know Tate's got other shit to do but selfishly I would love to see him in the ring one more time.  A savage in his prime. A legit killer. KO specialist. His way with words also made for a great build up.  Training hard atm. Looking petrifying. Youtube boxers hiding right now..

"This is the impact that Tate and TRW are having on the world,  Have your College professors ever been thanked by mothers for changing their son’s life?  Probably not.  How long will you wait before finally taking a decision?  Freedom requires you to ACT"
"There are only two ways to win.  Live a life that's pleasing to God or completely sell your soul to the devil.  The darkness gives you wins as well, but eventually it takes it all away.  Pleasing God is everlasting.  There's no in between."
"REMEMBER   The overwhelming power of a government, dedicating itself to scrutinizing every minute detail of his existence. Despite their exhaustive pursuit, not a single trace of evidence is discovered, leaving them incapable of concocting even a fabricated accusation, let alone…"
What’s her name?
"Back in January, a former romanian prosecutor claimed that someone has given an order for the Tate brothers to disappear because of their influence, especially Andrew because he's the most googled man with a vocal influence.  Somebody who has worked in the Romanian system."
"England will now attempt to put me in jail.   Matrix attacks via the ""justice"" system incoming.  The BBC have blocked the interview in the UK because of the destruction they suffered.  I have sank the HMS hood.  They will stop at nothing to destroy me.    Prayers welcome."
The matrix doesnt apologise.  They just accuse the people who expose them of sexual crimes while protecting the real predators.
"When’s ITV issuing an apology for covering up what Phillip Schofield was doing with the young runner, the young lad he’d been working on for years.    The damage controll they created to protect their brand that had the nation supporting him coming out when the truth was much…"
The USA and UK could save me at anytime.  But I have the wrong sexual orientation.  So they wont.
I am a political prisoner.  Abandoned by his home countries for wrong think.  Left to rot.
Only a Lada is strong enough to resist DIICOT.
"Say what you want about Andrew Tate but this is insane   She was furious the whole interview, all Tate does is tell niggas to do push ups and get rich   I’ve seen BBC reporters being nicer to Dictators"
"The level of stress and pressure I operate under would be too much for 99.99% of men.   They truly want me dead.   But I persist, day after day.  No alcohol. No drugs. No therapy.   Simply wake up. Pray.   Then get to work.   Allah is the best of planners."

"In the furnace of our hardships, we forge our resilience, turning every pain and struggle into the superpower of unwavering endurance, echoing the stoic belief that from adversity, we birth strength. Stay strong brother:"

"I harbour no hard feelings against the BBC or any journalist who attempts to lie about me.   The truth of my message is known and good will continue to spread.   Tolerance and love for all.   “If you had mercy on the sheep, then Allah will have mercy on you twice”"
BBC admitted they are done after the latest
The BBC when they see Andrew Tate:
You were one of the most powerful influences on earth Andrew!  They will not let you resume that status.
"They'll try to charge you with some BS tax thing maybe. but you'll have to pay the penalty.   Their ego won't let them loose 100%, not only the ego itself is also their public image.  Allah with you bros."
The Matrix will try frame you
The 6 month time limit to charge me is running out.   They have zero evidence against me (unless they invent it and frame me).  If they charge me with an empty bullshit file it’ll still take me a year to beat it and allows them to save face.   They’re hoping the world will forget…
Absolute insanity.
Theres no easy way out.   There’s no shortcut home…  14 months of investigation.   92 days in Romanian Prison.   Now locked in my house for 3 months.   Back in court today to see if I’m allowed to stay in my house or have to go back to jail.   STILL NOT CHARGED WITH ANY CRIME.
I choose to only interact with those who are respectful and civil in return for my own respect and civility  Tenet 36
There are people who injected themselves with experimental poison to protect against the common cold because a grey haired peadophile on ITV told them too.   I don’t know how these people sleep at night.   The shame would eat me alive.   But I guess cowards don’t have shame.

One of the largest mental shifts when you go from broke to rich is you realize how easy it was.  Perspicacity & hard work. Simple.  I’ve lost all respect for any man who’s not a millionaire.  Lazy. Arrogant. Stupid.  They are always one of the three.

G’s know how to conduct themselves.  G’s apologize if they bump into someone.  G's do not provoke or disrespect people.  G’s understand exactly how easy it is to kill somebody.  G's understand exactly how easy it is to be killed.  Understand?
