"ONCE I GET MY APARTMENT AND IM CLEAN, YOU WILL SEE ONE OF THE HARDEST WORKING PEOPLE ON EARTH.   FUCK DRUGS."
NO MORE DRUGS IM DONE
When I tried to commit suicide in 2018 and I got locked up I thought my life couple never get anyworrse.   This is 100x more pain
"Dear god, I have one wish one wish only. Please."
I have reached peak depression
Need to speak to a kind soul NOW
I’m so confused
I made today great
I’m choosing to be happy today. I don’t care what happens
I think I have someone watching over me who won’t let me die
Lost so many “friends”
I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR YOU
Staying positive  Staying positive   Staying positive  Staying positive  Staying positive  Staying positive   Staying positive  Staying positive  Staying positive  Staying positive   Staying positive  Staying positive
WOW I ACTUALLY AM HAVING AN AMAZING DAY    I MIGHT JUST NOT OFF MYSELF NOW
I WISH I HAD FRIENDS WHO CARE ABOUT ME THE WAY I CARE ABOUT THEM
Things just keep getting worse
I’ve just been feeling this way for years. It’s felt like no way out. I never posted this shit for attention. Just felt I had no where to go. The outreach is so heartwarming and I love you all 4L   No matter what happens to me don’t forget my message
"I love & appreciate you, I’m sorry   I dread waking up everyday   Some of you get it, some of you don’t"
Hope today’s my last
What do I do
I clearly am not dead for a reason. I’m here for a purpose. What could it be?
Im sorry hurt all of you
I just want to Rest In Peace
Canada where I belong fuck LA
I hope this is all happening for a reason
They say they love me but I don’t feel it
Everything is gonna be ok
I love Banks   We had our ups and downs over the years but that’s family. I hope I can get out of this strong and make you proud brother.
Just want real love
I just need you to trust me
We all grew up together  We’re family
You still love me right
