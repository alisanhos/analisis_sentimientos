NO MORE DRUGS IM DONE
When I tried to commit suicide in 2018 and I got locked up I thought my life couple never get anyworrse.   This is 100x more pain
"Dear god, I have one wish one wish only. Please."
I have reached peak depression
Need to speak to a kind soul NOW
I’m so confused
I made today great
I’m choosing to be happy today. I don’t care what happens
I think I have someone watching over me who won’t let me die
Lost so many “friends”
I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR YOU
Staying positive  Staying positive   Staying positive  Staying positive  Staying positive  Staying positive   Staying positive  Staying positive  Staying positive  Staying positive   Staying positive  Staying positive
WOW I ACTUALLY AM HAVING AN AMAZING DAY    I MIGHT JUST NOT OFF MYSELF NOW
I WISH I HAD FRIENDS WHO CARE ABOUT ME THE WAY I CARE ABOUT THEM
Things just keep getting worse
I’ve just been feeling this way for years. It’s felt like no way out. I never posted this shit for attention. Just felt I had no where to go. The outreach is so heartwarming and I love you all 4L   No matter what happens to me don’t forget my message
"I love & appreciate you, I’m sorry   I dread waking up everyday   Some of you get it, some of you don’t"
Hope today’s my last
What do I do
I clearly am not dead for a reason. I’m here for a purpose. What could it be?
Im sorry hurt all of you
I just want to Rest In Peace
Canada where I belong fuck LA
I hope this is all happening for a reason
They say they love me but I don’t feel it
Everything is gonna be ok
I love Banks   We had our ups and downs over the years but that’s family. I hope I can get out of this strong and make you proud brother.
Just want real love
I just need you to trust me
We all grew up together  We’re family
You still love me right
Worst birthday ever
Why do I even look at my DMs
STOP CARING WHAT PEOPLE THINK  THEY DONT KNOW YOU
Gotta watch ppl that value attention more than morals and principles
Respect is everything
I love real people with good intentions
The best thing you can be is understanding
If I died today my mom wouldn’t be able to describe me the right way. If she doesn’t know me there is absolutely no way you do nerd
The internet is fake
If you’re reading this I love you gang
Making people happy gives my heart a boner
KEEP IT REAL
FUCK FAKE PEOPLE
Be your own boss
My mental state has NEVER been better
Wish I never met you
COMING SOON
"JUST BE YOU, NOT EVERYONE IS GONNA UNDERSTAND YOU AND THATS OKAY.  THATS HOW I REALLY GOT OUT OF YEARS OF SERIOUS DEPRESSION. PLEASE, JUST BE YOU."
Can’t wait to fly my mom on private jets everywhere
Just woke up so fucking sick. Uh ohhhhhh
"Most people are fake, get used to it"
I don't know who to trust anymore
If you’re reading this I love you
I want to be FaZe Rain again
I LOVE LIL UZI VERT HOLY SHIT
Only way I won’t be a billionaire is if I die
"I was so depressed for so long i truly believed there was NO way I would ever be happy again. I could fucking cry at how happy I am right now. You all mean so much to me, no matter how hard it gets DO NOT GIVE UP."
This is how you KNOW the NY house is back
I FEEL REBORN. GOOD ENERGY ONLY. NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES LIFE KICKS ME DOWN IM GETTING MY ASS UP.
I hope I don’t jinx it but for the first time in years I am TRULY FUCKING HAPPY BITCH
The world shaped me wrong but my heart got nothing but love
Im either all in or all out   Fuck being in the middle

I feel like a kid again I love BLACK OPS 2

"Just because your life isn’t where you want it to be right now doesn’t mean it won’t ever be. Stay focused, be ready and keep chasing whatever it is that drives you everyday"
Black Ops 2 in 2020
I’ve been lost in my mind for years   I’m ready to come home
I can’t enjoy things like a regular human because I see through everything and everyone
Open your fucking eyes mate
Watching old FaZe House NY videos got me in my feels
I’ll never regret stepping away from the millions to work on my mental health
No one can touch Eminem
Drugs are evil
"Im so fucking upset. Juice WRLDs music meant so much to me, so talented and so young. So fucking much more to live for. This hurts bad."
RIP JUICE WRLD WTF MY HEART SUNK
Im sorry to everyone I hurt I want to be better
I love you so much

I want to tell you EVERYTHING. The whole truth. It’s the only way I can put my past behind me and move forward. I’m just scared to put all that out there.
FaZe Rain plays COD Modern Warfare

Why focus on bringing other people down when you could focus on bringing yourself up
I love you
Can’t tell whether I’m a genius or a psychopath
Fuck you
Why do I love watching bullies get instant karma and get beat up back
No way she’s a real person lmao
1.Canada is terrible.
Just because YOU think money and clout is happiness doesn’t mean everyone else does
I feel like I lost myself
Life’s just one big meme
People that know you the least think they know you the most
We all got our bad days
