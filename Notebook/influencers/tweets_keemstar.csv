"Internet culture has been saved!  The woke, cancel culture era is coming to a end.  I’m seeing multiple creators starting to voice opinions freely again.  Leafy , RiceGum , OG FaZe  & others are back.  De-platforming has ended with Elon Musk twitter & Rumble.  We have survived!"
"FaZe Rain confronted Grace in new video, and Grace began to cry and said she'd leave FaZe if the video got released."

FaZe Clan was such a powerful brand it used to build talent.   Now FaZe is such a weak brand it has to buy talent.
I been saying forever that crossover boxing is too competitive. We need to get back to influencer boxing.   Everyone was hating on me & my opinions for months.   Now they are switching up all saying what I been saying but acting like it’s their original take.
