In Mashhad police tried to arrest a Mother for not wearing her hijab. But her son defended her. The police handcuffed him to take him away. People got united-- forcing the police to release him. This is an example of people’s resistance against the regime.

Please tell me that your HP theme of 7’s doesn’t continue through to this being the last?
"I often get asked this. The honest answer is that you'll enjoy it more if you've read the first six, because you'll be much more invested in the two main characters and their story arc. However, each book is a standalone story."

THIS happened to a 70yo woman at the Auckland Let Women Speak event. Punched repeatedly by a male trans activist as she tried to get past.  The 'be kind' crowd is even trying to justify this. Where is the media reporting on this violence against women?

"The most comfortable place for women to stand has always been where there's most male approval. Such women sell out other women for their own benefit, then point to their personal success as a great feminist triumph."
"What is it with women politicians in particular who so easily give away such hard fought for women’s rights, children’s safeguards & free speech to say so? twitter.com/salltweets/sta…"
Every word of this.
"Men shouting at women to shut up - blocking passageways, banging on windows, throwing eggs, waving banners threatening decapitation - is exactly what it looks like. It has been happening in plain sight for years, at universities, at feminist gattherings, at party conferences."
