"This ""ratio'd"" trend is so bad, 99% of people who use it end up not ratioing and looking like liquid cringe. Bonus negative points if using celebrities to backup your trash"
I GREW UP HERE
HAVENT BEEN TWEETING MUCH SO HERES A CUTE RABBIT I SAW IN THE WOODS WHILE BIKING. HE LET ME APPROACH HIM CLOSE TO MELEE RANGE
"Byron knew I wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed but regardless, he always valued my opinion and listened to my optimistic rants about the things he was feeling. I always felt like I could get through to him and now I feel like I could've done more for him"
"Byron was an huge inspiration in many ways for me and and a lot of people/streamer. He changed streaming forever, we're going to miss him so much."
HYPOCRITE HAROLD
Never heard of it huh?
"DONT LET THE ANGLE FOOL YOU, SHES A FAT AND LAZY C H U N K"

MAXIMUM LEVEL JUICE ACHIEVED  I'm happy to announce we officially partnered with
"I SAID IT BEFORE AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN: WATCHPARTIES/RESTREAMS ARE NOT CANIBALISTIC, THEY ENHANCE THE CONTENT AND ADD TO IT WHEN DONE WELL. YOUR GARBAGE VIEWPOINT IS DAMAGING THE INDUSTRY."
MY MIND IS CONSTANTLY RACING SO FAST SO FAST SO FAST IT NEVER STOPS
I have no way of getting my setup to the old house for only 1 stream. I thought about everything. Spectrum fucked me over so internet can only be turned on tomorrow very early. So I dont think I can stream today. Yikes
"Moving today, stream might be a little delayed but we should be fine :) new location"
"GASH DARN WAS TODAY A TOTAL FAILURE HOLLLYYYYY. WHAT A DISASTER. TOMORROW WILL BE BETTER THOUGH, YOURS WILL BE TOO I GOT A GOOD FEELING ABOUT THIS ONE"
IS IT NORMAL THAT I GET UNREASONABLE AMOUNTS OF HAPPINESS WHEN I EAT POPSICLES?
"NOT A MUSIC ANALYST BUT I THINK CARTI IS CREATIVE AND HAS A UNIQUE STYLE. EVEN IF A LITTLE ODD HE IS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR EXCEPT THIS TIME, THAT VERSE AND THE NOISES SEEM REALLY FORCED AND OUT OF PLACE. IT'S OK THOUGH WE STILL LOVE EM"
Shocked we added another world champion?
Love our dances
"HOT TAKE: ALL THE WASHED UP CSGO ""PROS"" WILL TRY TO GO PRO IN VALORANT LIKE THEY DID IN OVERWATCH THEN COMPLAIN ABOUT REZ, SHIELDS AND THAT THE GAME REVOLVES AROUND MORE THAN SIMPLY SHOOTING A GUN AND ULTIMATELY QUIT."
WERE BACK TOMORROW AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
"I wanted to update everyone yesterday but it was unclear and I wanted to appeal and have a chance to explain myself. I did but it didn't matter, we're tanking the whole thing. Things are a little different than I expected but ultimately it was my fault. We'll roll when we're back"
Too much juice this time
"Hey @PlayDiabotical when is the game coming out? Also, could I get in please? I think i lost the email"
"WATCH THIS, THIS WILL HELP YOU ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS IM NOT KIDDING"
"""didn't ask"" is the most degenerate stupidest meme of the decade. Change my mind"
"As a kid we would never buy a whole skateboard, only pieces here and there when they broke or got worn. Buying a whole setup today and being able to share that with others was pretty exciting, thanks for being there for it"
Ok I'll let chat pick
"Something came up, unable to do full desktop stream today. Ubering to some skatepark right now, gonna stream some skating we'll see how it goes. Need to buy one b4, should I stream that part?"
"I LOVE DRAMA DONT GET ME WRONG BUT LITERALLY ALL THE ""SPICE"" FROM FORTNITE COMES OUT AS PURE LIQUID CRINGE. AND THE COMMENTS ARE EVEN WORSE WTF"
SHOULDA BEEN ASLEEP FOR THE PAST TWO HOURS BUT IVE BEEN WATCHING VIDEOS OF LARVA BEING REMOVED FROM CATS. WHY????!?!
